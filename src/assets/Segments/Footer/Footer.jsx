                <h3>[-] State is mutable/changeable. On the other hand Props are immutable</h3>
                <h3>[-] State is managed within the Component. Props are passed on from one to another</h3>
                <h3>[-] State Changes can be asynchronus. Props are 'read only'</h3>
                <h3>[-] State can used to display changes with the component. Props are used to communicate between components</h3>

                <h3>[-] Importing the useState let's us keep a local state in a function component.</h3>
                <h3>
                    [-] we declare a new state variable by calling the useState Hook. It returns a
                    pair of values, to which we give names. We initialize the first variable to a default state by
                    passing an initial value as the only useState argument. The second returned item is itself a function.
                    It lets us update the First variable.
                </h3>
                <h3>[-] When the user clicks a relative fuction, we call the second variable with a new value. React will then re-render the component,
                    passing the new value to the first variable for our use.
                </h3>

            <div className='h2div'><h2>3. What else does useEffect do except for Data Load?</h2></div>
            <div className="h3div">
                <h3>[-] When we need to use an effect that triggers only once when the component has mounted we can pass an empty array as a second argument to the useEffect hook.</h3>
                <h3>[-] When we need to use an effect that triggers only when specific props/state have been updated, we can pass those props in the second argument array. This is also useful to enhance performance (run specific logic only when a specific prop has been updated).</h3>
                <h3>[-] In case we want the effect to trigger upon any change, instead of passing an array, we donâ€™t pass a second argument.</h3>
                <h3>[-] useEffect allows us to easily separate logic over several functions, instead of placing all the logic in a single function.</h3>
